Even a small difference in interest rates or monthly payments can make a large difference in how much you ultimately pay for your mortgage.  However, these details are often buried in masses of paperwork--so it pays to be able to calculate the long-term cost of a mortgage yourself.\n",

    "  * If this happens, the program should stop and display an appropriate error message.  \n",

    "5.  Use the modulus or $\\%$  operator to separate the years and months.\n",
    "6.  Your program should only display the columns requested, and the rows should be formatted to appear under the appropriate heading.\n",
    "7.  Because this is an iPython notebook, which is inherently interactive, don't use the `input` function to make your code interactive.  Instead, set the values of the input (such as the interest rate) as variables defined at the top of your code.  Alternatively, if you write one or more functions, you can set the input as the arguments of your function(s).\n"
